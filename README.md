# Employee Payroll Tracker Starter Code

## Description

this is Java code that I figured out the logic for to get the page working properly
I was able to do this by learning the different functions of javaScript and by
understanding what the functions do for each line



## Usage

this can be used to add employee names and salaries to a roster in the HTML as well as the console then calculate the average in the console and pick a random winner from the list of names.
